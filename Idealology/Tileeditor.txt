the problem with that as a tile set is that the building will block the player or w/e but i had an idea, what if theres a seperate tile editor that can select the tiles from the inputted tilemap, and have multiple tile maps and have a tool that can select the tiles and add attributes like drawover the player and set opacity and set blocking or non blocking and have a rectile that select the tile from the tile editor window one tile editor can be for the main tilesets, and then have a tab to select buildings tileset and place rectangles over the building to set certain attributes and also a special function that converts the  the selected area to a sprite object and adds it to the GOM with a database of objects and with the rects in the building tile editor have different colored rects dragged with the mouse, clicked to place over the tiles and hold alt and click to remove the rect from the tiles have a menu of set attributes. to also mention insted of having an object as a rect it could be a multirect shape
